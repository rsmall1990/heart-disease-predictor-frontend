# Heart Disease Predictor

This app was created to test the ability to create a client-side deployment of a ML algorithm based on user data. It does not (yet!) re-train based on user defined data. However it does append the user-inputed data to the existing data-set. The purpose of the app is not to explore the full implementation of an ML deployment, but rather a proof of concept. To that end please see the below sections for more detail on the technologies used and reference material.
