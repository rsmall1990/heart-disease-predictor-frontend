            These models are built for the explicit purpose of helping human beings do things better.  And we shouldn't assume everyone who wants to interact with a ML application will have the experience or desire to use Jupiter-Notebooks or a Python CLI.

It's not particularly sophistocated, nor was it intended to be. And that's okay.
